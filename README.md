Attached here is a link to zip containing a data file containing all pitches from the 2011 MLB season and the associated metadata describing the data.

Please review the dataset and start outlining the way you would go about the model-building process with the goal of predicting the probability that the next thrown pitch will be a fastball, slider, change-up, etc.

We would like to see you assess the data, build a predictive model, and then evaluate that model and the success of its predictions
